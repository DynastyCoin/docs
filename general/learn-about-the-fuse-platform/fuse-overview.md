# Dynasty Overview: vision, strategy and platform components

Dynasty aims to be a decentralized payments platform capable of unifying diverse kingdoms and dynasties through a robust financial system. Our vision is a world where transactions are quick, inexpensive, and efficient, facilitated by a community-driven blockchain network.

Dynasty leverages the strength of DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) technologies to create a fast and secure blockchain. Its strategic focus is on creating interoperability with other major chains to expand the scope and utility of its native DNY token.

### The Problem

The world today is as interconnected as it has ever been, yet it is still fragmented in many crucial waysâ€”none more evident than in the financial systems that underpin our global economies. These systems are often not only disconnected but are also bogged down by inefficiencies, high costs, and long processing times. This is particularly challenging for historically rich but isolated communities such as kingdoms and dynasties, which face unique hurdles.

**Fragmented Systems**

Each kingdom or dynasty typically has its own unique financial systems, currencies, and economic policies. This fragmentation makes it challenging to perform smooth and efficient transactions between different regions, causing economic opportunities to be missed and contributing to financial inequality.

**Inefficiencies and Costs**

Traditional financial systems often require multiple intermediaries, each taking a cut and adding time and complexity to the process. Currency exchange rates and fees can further compound the cost and complexity. For kingdoms that often have extensive wealth tied up in non-liquid assets, these inefficiencies can be particularly burdensome.

**Cultural and Geographical Barriers**

Cultural differences and geographical distances can exacerbate the existing financial disconnection between kingdoms. From language barriers to varying regulatory landscapes, these differences can make it hard to create a unified system that respects the individuality of each kingdom while offering universal functionality.

**Lack of Transparency**

Current systems often lack transparency, making it difficult to track the flow of assets and verify transactions. This opacity can result in fraud, corruption, and a general lack of trust between different parties.

**Limited Accessibility**

Even with modern technology, remote or smaller kingdoms may have limited access to global financial networks, causing them to rely on outdated or less secure means of transactions.

By addressing these issues head-on, Dynasty aims to revolutionize the way kingdoms and dynasties interact financially, leveraging the advantages of blockchain technology to offer a solution that is fast, low-cost, and universally applicable.

### What the crypto industry still lacks

The cryptocurrency industry has revolutionized many aspects of traditional finance, from enabling peer-to-peer transactions to offering decentralization and transparency. However, there are still a number of important areas where the industry falls short, many of which are particularly relevant for the unique needs of kingdoms and dynasties.

**Scalability**

Many popular blockchain platforms face significant scalability issues. As the number of users and transactions grows, the system often becomes slow, leading to delayed transactions and increased costs. This makes such platforms impractical for widespread adoption among kingdoms, which require high-volume, quick transactions.

**Interoperability**

Although there are thousands of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects, very few of them can interact seamlessly with one another. The lack of interoperability limits the utility of any single currency or token and adds complexity to cross-chain transactions, a necessary feature for the diverse kingdoms and dynasties Dynasty aims to serve.

**User Experience**

The average user often finds the crypto space to be complex and intimidating due to its technical nature, unfamiliar terminology, and sometimes complex user interfaces. This can deter adoption among kingdoms that might not be tech-savvy or have citizens who are new to the concept of digital currencies.

**Regulatory Compliance**

The landscape of crypto regulations is often described as the Wild West. The lack of a standardized legal framework can lead to uncertainty and risk. For kingdoms and dynasties that are steeped in tradition and often have their own sets of rules and regulations, navigating this can be a major hurdle.

**Financial Inclusion**

Despite its global reach, the crypto industry has not yet fully solved the problem of financial inclusion. Rural or less developed regions often find it difficult to access these technologies, which can further exacerbate economic disparities.

**Trust and Security**

While blockchain is touted as a secure technology, the ecosystem surrounding it (exchanges, wallets, smart contracts) has been plagued by hacks, fraud, and other security issues. For kingdoms with significant wealth and legacy, these concerns are even more pronounced.

**Cultural Sensitivity**

Most crypto platforms are built with a one-size-fits-all approach, often neglecting cultural, social, and historical factors that are crucial for more traditional societies like kingdoms and dynasties.

By identifying these gaps in the current crypto industry, Dynasty positions itself to not just be another blockchain platform, but a comprehensive solution tailored to address these specific, unmet needs.

### How we go about it

Dynasty employs a multi-pronged approach to address these issues:

**Speed and Cost**

By employing a DPOS consensus mechanism, Dynasty can process transactions at a much faster rate compared to traditional crypto networks, and at a fraction of the cost.

**Interoperability**

Dynasty aims to establish secure bridges with other major blockchains, enabling cross-chain transactions and expanding the utility of the DNY token.

**Community Governance**

Decisions related to the development and governance of Dynasty will be made through community proposals and voting, leveraging the decentralization aspects of blockchain technology.

### Platform Components

The Dynasty platform has three main components:

1\) **The Dynasty blockchain**. The EVM-compatible public blockchain is the decentralized, permissionless backbone of the Dynasty platform and ecosystem.

2\) **The mobile-centric open-source technology stack** designed to help businesses and developers plug crypto payments into real-world use cases. This toolkit has subsumed into the new Dynasty Charge API platform.

3\) **A set of reference decentralized finance (DeFi) products and tools**. The goal of these is to pave the way for the initial adoption of the platform.&#x20;
