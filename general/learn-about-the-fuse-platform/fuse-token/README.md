# Dynasty Token (DNY)

The DNY token is the native currency of the Dynasty blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## DNY utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Dynasty blockchain, DNY is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Dynasty to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 10K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.dynastycoin.io/](https://status.dynastycoin.io/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked DNY. Which means validators with higher amounts of Dynasty staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any DNY holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of DNY they wish. They receive a share of the Dynasty block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As DNY is the native currency on Dynasty, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, DNY transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of DNY tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Dynasty platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
